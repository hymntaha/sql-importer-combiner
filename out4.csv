When brushed onto baked ham, barbecued meats or baked vegetables corn syrup is an ideal glaze. In baked goods, corn syrup holds moisture and maintains freshness longer.

It controls sugar crystallization in candy, prevents the formation of ice crystals in frozen desserts, enhances fresh fruit flavor in jams and preserves, sweetens and thickens relishes and chutneys. Corn syrup balances sweet and sour flavor profiles, and is therefore a key ingredient in many Asian dishes. When brushed onto baked ham, barbecued meats or baked vegetables corn syrup is an ideal glaze. In baked goods, corn syrup holds moisture and maintains freshness longer.

It is an easy-blendin, natural sweetener that enhances the flavor and texture of many foods, such as baked goods, caramel popcorn, candy, meat and vegetable glazes, fruit toppings and beverages.

Gluten free. Contains no high fructose corn syrup.","Corn syrup serves different functions in different types of recipes. It controls sugar crystallization in candy, prevents the formation of ice crystals in frozen desserts, enhances fresh fruit flavor in jams and preserves, sweetens and thickens relishes and chutneys. Corn syrup balances sweet and sour flavor profiles, and is therefore a key ingredient in many Asian dishes. When brushed onto baked ham, barbecued meats or baked vegetables corn syrup is an ideal glaze. In baked goods, corn syrup holds moisture and maintains freshness longer. Karo Light and Dark corn syrups perform similarly in recipes and can usually be used interchangeably. Typically, Karo Dark Corn Syrup is used when a more robust molasses-like flavor is desired whereas Karo Light Corn Syrup is used when a more delicate flavor is desired.  Recipes usually specify which type to use but the choice may be guided by personal preference.","This product is packaged in a white pail with pour spout and handle.
